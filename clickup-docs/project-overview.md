# TechD Website Rebuild — Project Overview

## What this project is

TechD is an IBM Platinum Business Partner delivering AI, data, security, automation, cloud, and application modernization to Fortune 500 clients (J&J, Comcast, Sony, Princeton, Johns Hopkins).

The current `techd.com` runs on a **fully compromised WordPress install** with SEO spam injected at the theme level. This project replaces it with a modern, fast marketing site — a clean break with no file migration from WordPress.

**Business goal:** A credible digital face that matches the sophistication of TechD's enterprise clients and supports lead generation.

## What still needs to happen before public launch

See the **Deferred Items** document for the full list. Key blockers:

| Item | Owner | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Logo SVG files** (color + white) | Product owner | Wordmark placeholder in use — cannot launch with this |
| **Hero copy / mission statement sign-off** | Product owner | Placeholder text in hero until approved |
| **Contact form backend** | Engineering | AWS Lambda + SES function not yet built |
| **301 redirect activation** | Engineering + IT | Redirect map is ready; needs Cloudflare proxy or CloudFront in front of GitHub Pages |
| **WordPress server decommission** | Product owner decision | Fully compromised — needs forensic review or explicit decision to skip |
| **DNS cutover to techd.com** | Product owner + IT | Coordinate timing and rollback plan |

## Friday handoff

This staging build is **production-quality code, ready for content review and stakeholder sign-off.** It is not a public launch.

Before the site goes live at `techd.com`, a hardening phase is required. See the Deferred Items document for what that includes.
